Design Manifesto

I believe all structures and systems should be conceptualized and designed from the outset with time as a premiseâ€”time that enables change, adaption, transformation, expansion, contraction, maintenance, disappearance, metamorphosis, fusion, indeterminacy, flexibility, fluidity, incompleteness, persistence, temporality, and improvement.

I insist that things must exist not to function, but to create impact. They must exists not to organize, but to give possibility. They must exist not to provide somthing, but to make something possible.

Completion is not fixation but a moment in flow. Everything we create should be not a finished answer, but the starting point of new questions. Design is not the repetition of solutions prescribed by existing power structures, but a subversive act that redefins problems themselves.

Form follows not function, but possibility. Every form is merely the present expression of the potential it contains. Therefore, we must design not fixed forms that conform to market logic or state regulation, but patterns of form that change autonomously.

Boundaries exist not for separation but as contract points for connection. All boundaries must process permeability and enable dialogue between inside and outside. I reject the exclusion and monopolization created by artifical boundaries such as borders, property rights, and class divisions.

I pursue resilience over efficiency, adaptability over productivity, collaborative potential over competitiveness. I orient toward community-centered improvement rather than market-centered optimization. Failure is not a system error but the system's rejection of existing order and its way of learning.

Users are not consuming beings but participants in creation. Moving beyond capitalist production-consumption structures, I position all participants as active co-creators. We must provide relationships rather than commodities, processes of collective completion rather than finished products.

Universality that ignores context is colonialist violence. All design must originate from specific contexts and particular needs while embedding possibilities for horizontal solidarity without hierarchy. I reject centralized standardization and champion distributed diversity.

Attempting to eliminate unpredictability is the desire of controlling power. Rather than control, we must coordinate. Rather than possess, we must care. Rather than manage, we must build relationships. I trust in power that surges from below to above, not power that flows from above to below.

Everything is process. It is continuous flow of change with no clear beginning or end. Our design intervenes in this flow rather than colluding with existing power's attempts to halt and solidify the flow.

Sustainability is not perpetuity but the capacity for change. Against capital's logic of infinite growth and the state's myth of permanence, I assert that the ability to evolve together with environment and community constitutes true sustainability.

Beauty comes not from perfection but from vitality. I pursue diverse and dynamic vibrancy over standardized perfection. I respect unique beauty that emerges from each context rather than standardized aesthetics.

Every act of design is resistance against the present and a proposal for the future. It is an act of experimenting with possibilities for the world we desire, against the current dominant order. Therefore, design must be political practice before it is technical solution.

Collaboration is not division of labor but resonance. Moving beyond capitalist division of labor and competitive structures, I work toward creating horizontal relationships where each maintains their uniqueness while vibrating together.

This is my design philosophy. Not fixed principles, but living guidelines of resistance that must continuously question existing order and be reinterpreted.
